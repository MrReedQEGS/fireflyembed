non-turtle stuff
it creates my_prog even if it already exists and I think it can write over the one you have if you are not careful.

turtle stuff
ordering messed up.  If you draw squares and print "square 1" "square 2" etc.  The prints all happen instantly while the drawing is still happening.  Adding a seq with AI might help?
ability to resize all 3 windows
zoom in and out of drawing window
drawing not deleted when window resized
save, upload, etc. just like the non turtle one.
turtle shape choices?  Could I store the .png on my github and load them in.
Same for fifa card, etc.  Could a list of available assets be seen and selectable to place on the drawing somehow?
More than one turtle.
Colours
begin_fill() etc.
The rest of the PLS
The screen bit where you can change the drawing size, so it will need bars at the side to scroll if the image is bigger than the window.
Button to hide the conosle or hide the turtle window
text on the drawing with fonts, etc.
